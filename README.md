## lslvm

A simpleish command line utility I use to list the layout/configuration of LVM volumes/groups on linux.

This is a rewrite of a similar (but hackier) script I had previously written in bash.

Not (yet?) fully featured, and could use some better formatting of the output, but works for my purposes. Nothing in particular planned for this, but I imagine I'll improve the tool as the need develops.

Bug reports welcome.


#### Usage (needs root)

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec ./bin/table.rb
```
